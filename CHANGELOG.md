### ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

This release represents a complete rewrite of the app, making it easier to use, much faster, and cleaner under the hood. We've revamped the user interface, speeding up the code behind the scenes so many tasks now take milliseconds instead of seconds.

- **Auxiliary Pioneer Form**
- **Ministry Timer Widget**
- **Publisher Records**
- **Advanced Public Talk Scheduling Features**
- **Service Year Overview**
- **New Meeting Print Templates**
- **Many Data Now Available for S-Form Export**
- **Big Privacy & Security Updates**
- **And So Much More!**

The autofill system has been updated with new algorithms for faster, more accurate data entry. The app is now available in dozens of languages, making it easy to start using right away. In short, the app is brand new, allowing you to migrate your older data and start enjoying a much smoother and more efficient experience.
